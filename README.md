This project aims to analyze and predict soccer player performance using machine learning. By leveraging datasets of player statistics and match footage, the model predicts metrics like player efficiency, skill impact, and future performance trends.

The project utilizes tools such as Roboflow for data preparation and Python-based machine learning libraries (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch) for model training and evaluation.
