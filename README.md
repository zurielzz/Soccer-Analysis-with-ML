# Soccer Player Performance Prediction

This project aims to analyze and predict soccer player performance using machine learning. By leveraging datasets of player statistics and match footage, the model predicts metrics like player efficiency, skill impact, and future performance trends.

The project utilizes tools such as Roboflow for data preparation and Python-based machine learning libraries (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch) for model training and evaluation.

## Features
- **Data Collection**: Integration of soccer datasets, including player stats and match results.
- **Data Annotation**: Labeling player actions and movements from match footage using Roboflow.
- **Model Training**:
  - Classification models to predict player performance categories (e.g., excellent, good, average).
  - Object detection models to track player movements during games.
- **Deployment**: API integration for real-time predictions or batch analysis of player data.
